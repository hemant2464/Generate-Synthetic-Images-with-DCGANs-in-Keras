# Generate Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Keras

Fashion GAN Project

Introduction

Welcome to the Fashion GAN hands-on project! In this interactive project, I'll guide you through the process of understanding and implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Keras with Tensorflow 2 as the backend. The focus will be on building and training a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate images of fashionable clothes using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Project Overview

Problem Statement
In our GAN setup, we aim to generate realistic images of fashionable clothes. However, sampling directly from the complex, high-dimensional distribution of Fashion MNIST images is challenging. To overcome this, we'll utilize a simpler distribution, such as Gaussian noise, and leverage the power of neural networks to learn a transformation from the simple distribution to the target distribution.

Components
The GAN architecture comprises two main players: the discriminator and the generator. Through joint training in a minimax game-theoretic formulation, the model will learn to generate compelling images that resemble the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

Introduction to GANs: Understand the fundamentals of Generative Adversarial Networks and their role in image generation.
Setting up the Environment: Configure your environment with Keras and Tensorflow 2 to ensure a smooth implementation experience.
Loading and Preprocessing Data: Explore the Fashion MNIST dataset and preprocess it for training the GAN.
Building the Discriminator: Construct the discriminator model that evaluates the realism of generated images.
Building the Generator: Develop the generator model responsible for creating synthetic images.
Training the GAN: Implement the training loop to simultaneously optimize the discriminator and generator.
Generating Fashionable Images: Generate fashion images using the trained GAN model.
